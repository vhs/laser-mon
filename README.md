Laser Power Monitor
===================

Note: Modifications to the ESP8266 SDK were made in order to allow for microsecond timers to work correctly.  See https://gilbertway.net/arduino-ide-esp8266-usec-timer/

Wiring
------

The sensor board has an RJ-45 connector and cable with the following four wires that connect to the laser's PSU.

| Colour        | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Red           | 5V            |
| Black         | GND           |
| Green         | PWM IN        |
| Yellow        | TTL           |

PWM IN is a PWM signal generated by the controller. TTL is just a simple "enable" signal.
We monitor both.
